**2021/03**
- current branch was behind remote. Forgot I had whitelisted Screaming Frog in a previous commit on the remote host. Used -f to overwrite.

**2022/02**
- updated to Version: V3.2022.02.1316
- sync'd referrers and added some custom referrers and IPs. 
- rm screaming üê∏  from globalblacklist so I can use it.
- since the IP blacklist is not really kept up to day, I'm using IPs gathered from several list @ [https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence](https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence)

**2022/06**
- updated to Version: V3.2022.05.1398
- added IPs and referrers from server logs
- easy to check IP abuse @ [https://www.abuseipdb.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com)
- added sudo command to git pull so that files retain root permissions. see: [https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/)
