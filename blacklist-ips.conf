# Cyveillance / Qwest Communications
# **********************************
# I am extensively researching this subject - appears to be US government involved
# and also appears to be used by all sorts of law enforcement agencies. For one they 
# do not obey robots.txt and continually disguise their User-Agent strings. Time will
# tell if this is all correct or not.
# For now see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyveillance

# IMPORTANT UPDATE ON Cyveillance / Qwest Communications !!!
# **********************************************************
# I have done a lot of research on Cyveillance now and through monitoring my logs I know
# for sure what companies are using them and what they are actually looking for.
# My research has led me to understand that Cyveillance services are used by hundreds
# of companies to help them dicsover theft of copyrighted materials like images, movies
# music and other materials. I personally believe a lot of block lists who originally recommended
# blocking Cyveillance have done so to protect their torrent or p2p sites from being scanned.
# I personally have now unblocked them as image theft is a big problem of mine but if you
# do want to block Cyveillance you can simply modify the entries in the block below from "0" to "1"
# Getty Images is one such company who appears to use Cyveillance to help monitor for copyright theft.
  
# If you really do want to block them change all the "Allow from" statements below to "deny from".
